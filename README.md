# Plug It

Plug It is a web application developed as part of a Web Development course at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The app helps electric vehicle (EV) users locate charging stations across Finland with real-time data and an interactive map. The project emphasizes usability, secure authentication, and mobile responsiveness.
