  'We are a team of four innovative students from Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, united by a shared passion for sustainable technology and user-centric design. Our journey began with a simple idea: to make electric vehicle (EV) charging accessible, seamless, and efficient for all. With this vision in mind, we co-created Plug It, a comprehensive and interactive charging station map designed to transform the EV charging experience. At Metropolia, we’ve combined our expertise in software engineering, design, and project management to address a real-world need. Our platform connects drivers with real-time information about charging stations, allowing them to plan their journeys with ease and confidence. By integrating cutting-edge technologies like the Open Charge Map API, advanced sorting and filtering tools, and a vibrant user community, Plug It provides an unparalleled experience for EV owners. As a student-led project, we are proud to contribute to the growing EV ecosystem, fostering a cleaner, greener tomorrow. Join us on our journey to revolutionize how you charge your car.';
